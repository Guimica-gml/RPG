[Turn-Based RPG Documentation]

- Managers:
	All managers are always present in all scenes (as autoloads)
	There's a reference for all managers at Global.cs, they can be accessed by simply using Global.{manager name}
	Ex.: Global.Manager or Global.InteractionManager
	If you want to create a manager, you have to add it's scene as an autoload, than create a variable for it in Global.cs
	The variable must be marked with `static`, it's also highly recomended to add `{ get; private set; }`

- Interactions:
	The interactions are controled by the InteractionManager
	
	There are three types of interactions in the game by now:
		-> DialogInteractions.cs: Starts an dialog (see the `Dialogs` section)
		-> TransitionInteractions.cs: Starts an transition (see the `Transitions` section)
		-> ShopInteractions.cs: Opens the shop displayer (see the `Shops` section)
	
	To create an interaction you have to create a new script that inherits Interaction.cs
	Than create the functions that you have to override the logic, they are:
		-> bool CanTrigger():
			if you need any kind of condition for the action to show up you have to put it here,
			if it returns true the icon to interaction will popup, otherwise the icon won't appear
		-> void OnTrigger():
			TODO
		-> void OnEnd():
			TODO
		-> Texture GetIcon():
			TODO
