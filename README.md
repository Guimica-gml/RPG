# RPG

A turn-based RPG developed using Godot Engine
This project was created based on Gurpreet Singh Matharoo's version of a turn-based rpg created with GameMaker Studio
You can find his code at:
https://github.com/gurpreetsinghmatharoo/gms2.3-turn-based-rpg

I tried to recreate his game but using Godot instead of GameMaker
It's not 100% similar, but it's pretty close

I also added some features that are not present in his project
I just felt like adding them would be nice, so I did
